My short 3D Animation Work

A Yoga Day reel has been done using an environmental modelled scene by me and Dana rig made by Gabriel Salas plus a cricket rig made by Truong.
Ultimate Bony rig doing walk cycle, was done by me using the rig developed by U. Yetiskin.
Burly Villager was done completely by me, after reference sketch and low poly modelling. 
A small piece having Dana screaming was rendered in arnold. A scene of 1 sec took 3,5 days non stop rendering. Impossible to render the whole scene. More small pieces of the reel rendered are about to come.

thanks
